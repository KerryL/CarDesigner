==============================================================================================================

NOTE:  The VVASE project files are set up to use shared libraries (.dlls) for Debug builds, and static linking
for release builds.  For Release builds under MSW, be sure to select MT linking for MSVC runtime libraries (as
opposed to MD which is usually default).

Necessary to build project:

wxWidgets
---------
wxWidgets 2.8.10-12 (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
For instructions on building wxWidgets and setting up your own project in windows see:
	http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Microsoft_Visual_CPP_Guide
And under GTK:
	http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Compiling_and_getting_started

My instructions (wxMSW):
1.	Download wxMSW-2.8.10-Setup.exe from www.wxwidgets.org (go to downloads page, click on wxMSW).  Run/extract
	the file.
2.	Add an environment variable called WXWIN that points to the directory that you just installed wxWidgets in.
3.	Make the changes described below.
4.	Edit the setup.h file found inclue/wx/msw to set wxUSE_GLCANVAS to 1
5.	Follow the procedures described in the links above.
6.  Project settings should be modified as follows:
    a) Use Multi-byte character set
	b) Use pre-processor flags __WXMSW__;__WXDEBUG__;WXUSINGDLL (if using .dlls)

My instructions (wxGTK):
1.  Configure with "../configure --disable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-debug"
2.  Make the changes described below.
3.  Follow the procedures described in the links above.

The following changes need to be made to the wxWidgets source code:
1.	For all platforms, make the changes described in ticket #10057 (http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/10057)
	OR:  See change described here: http://trac.wxwidgets.org/changeset/59417 - should we switch to this method? -> Not yet!
2.	Under GTK, make the changes described in the first post here:  http://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?t=16032

Freetype2
---------
http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html
Build multithreaded debug .dll and multithreaded release static libs.

FTGL
----
FTGL 2.1.3
Freetype2 must be built first.  Create environment variable FREETYPE pointing to the location where Freetype2 is installed before
building FTGL.
After buidling FTGL, create an environment variable called FTGL (for building VVASE).

Some additional changes are required:  In .dll project, change freetype library from freetype234_D.lib to freetype239MT_D.lib and
add "win32/vc2008" to the end of the freetype path in the "additional libraries directories" field in the project properties.
