Known Bugs (TODO)
-----------------
The following is a partial list of the bugs and limitations that pertain to the current version of VVASE:
- Only supports double A-Arm suspensions
- Third shocks/springs are not yet supported
- There is currently no way to mount the rear tie rod to anything except the tub
- A number of minor bugs in the way that information is displayed (names get cut off, extra white space around
  grids, etc.)
- Anti-lift for FWD is not accurate
- Anti-geometries are only accurate for zero configuration (no pitch, roll, heave, or steer)


Pre-version 1.0 warning - this software is still in development.  There may be bugs that affect the stability
of the software as well as its accuracy.  If you become aware of any such problems, please let me know by
