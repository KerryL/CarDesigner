Use namespace
Think through file structure/organization
Use LibPlot2D
Write Plugin abstract class and test class
Re-structure core to include:
    - Abstract CarSubSystem class
        - What to do with things like tires, which are a component but we also want to derive from?
            - Include Tire (subsystem), which allows user to specify which TireModel (abstract) to include
            - So we need a TireModel abstract class and RegisterTireModel method (register with tire component?)
    - Car with RegisterSubsystem method
    - Abstract Analyis class
    - Gui "manager" class with RegisterAnalysis
