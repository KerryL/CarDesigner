%\vvase{} was designed as a tool that could be useful throughout the process of designing and testing a vehicle.  The vision was a single product that could perform kinematic analysis, dynamic simulation, process tire data and replay recorded data.

\vvase{} is a tool for analyzing suspension kinematics.  Given the locations of the suspension linkages and the kinematic state of the vehicle (pitch, roll, heave and steer), many output values are computed.  These outputs are key indicators of suspension performance and vehicle handling qualities.

There are other tools available that peform similar functions, but \vvase{} was designed with two unique features that make it stand out.

First, \vvase{} was designed to ease the process of evaluating differences between design options.  Always visible is a panel that displays the differences between all open car files for the specified kinematic state.  Additionally, iteration files can be used to compare kinematic outputs across a range of kinematic states - simultanously for as many car files as desired.  The iterations and panel displaying the kinematic outputs update continuously as suspension hardpoints are varied.

Second, \vvase{} provides a unique facility for performing complex optimizations.  These optimizations are based on a genetic search algorithm that allows the user complete control over the optimization process.  Genetic search algorithms allow broad coverage of highly non-linear solution spaces and can help avoid getting trapped at local minima.  In suspension design, moving a single hardpoint can affect many output paramters.  An optimization tool that balances multiple constraints is invaluable.

Currently, \vvase{} is limited to cars employing a double A-arm suspension at both ends.  It supports several spring/damper attachment methods, U-bar and T-bar anti-roll bars, asymmetric suspensions and several other configuration options that allow virtually any double A-arm suspension to be modeled.
