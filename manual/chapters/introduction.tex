%\vvase{} was designed as a tool that could be useful throughout the process of designing and testing a vehicle.  The vision was a single product that could perform kinematic analysis, dynamic simulation, process tire data and replay recorded data.

\vvase{} is a tool for analyzing suspension kinematics.  Although there are other tools available that can also help analyze suspension kinematics, \vvase{} provides a unique facility for performing complex optimizations.

Often times, engineering problems 

software is very powerful, can solve any problem, but only for expert users.  Hard to be confident that input values are correct; hard to be confident outpus are interpreted correctly.

The types of problems facing engineers are very broad.
