Goals for re-write:
-------------------
- Use templates to define cars (more flexibility to handle arbitrary geometries)
	- Also define outputs this way?
- Better code design
	- Looser coupling
	- Better use of objects
	- Easier to test
	- De-couple library from GUI
	- Re-organize file structure and combine into a single library
	- Better unit conversion design (easier to add unit/types of units)
	- Less buggy threading
	- Less buggy UI updates
	- Use DataPlotter
- Automated code testing
- Support future features
	- Dynamic simulation
		- Shaker rig
		- LTS
		- MMM (quasi-steady state)
	- DOE?
	- Data playback
	- GGV
	- Forces analysis
- Better UI design
	- Hide vehicle options in context menus (or dialogs accessed from context menus) and file menus
