VVASE (Virtual Vehicle Analysis and Simulation Environment)
===========================================================

VVASE is a suspension kinematics analysis tool.  It is licsensed under the GPLv3 license.  See [the manual](http://github.com/KerryL/DataPlotter/wiki/Home) for more information.

VVASE is built upon wxWidgets, OpenGL, Freetype2 and FTGL.  It compiles and runs under both MSW and GTK.

VVASE was created many years ago in order to support an experiment in suspension geometry optimization.  Along the way, I became interested in other aspects of vehicle design, and additional features were added.  There is a long list of future improvements, which will be implemented as time allows.  For now, hopefully some others will find this useful as-is.

Feedback is welcome!  Please log any issues/feature requests through the GitHub issue tracker.
